Simple implementation of serial communication between sim800l module 
and 8052 MCU using DTMF tones.

`**Project Title:**`  
Embedded C and 8052 Assembly-Based DTMF-Controlled Appliance Automation System

`**Project Overview:**`

This project involves the development of an Embedded C and 8052 Assembly-based system for remote appliance control using Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones. The project follows a typical Input → Processing → Output task flow, with user-input DTMF tones processed by the 8052 microcontroller to generate appropriate output signals. In the demonstration phase, LED bulbs are employed as representative appliances, controlled by DTMF commands sent from a user's cell phone.

`**Key Components and Functionalities:**`

1. `**DTMF Tone Input:**`
   - Receive DTMF tones as input signals from a user's cell phone.
   - Process the received tones to extract control commands.

2. `**8052 Microcontroller:**` 
   - Utilize the 8052 microcontroller to process and interpret the received DTMF tones.
   - Implement control logic based on the interpreted tones.

3. `**Appliance Control:**`
   - Interface with appliances (e.g., LED bulbs) to control their state (on/off).
   - Respond to DTMF commands by toggling the state of the connected appliances.

4. `**IR Sensor Integration:**`
   - Incorporate Infrared (IR) sensors to detect changes in the environment or appliance status.

5. `**SMS Notification:**`
   - Implement SMS notification functionality to alert users in response to IR sensor triggers.
   - Notify users of specific events or changes in the environment via SMS.

`**Expected Outcomes:**`

1. A functional DTMF-controlled appliance automation system.
2. Demonstration of DTMF tone interpretation and appliance control using the 8052 microcontroller.
3. Integration of IR sensors for environment monitoring and event notification via SMS.

`**Significance:**`

This project showcases the application of Embedded C and 8052 Assembly language in the development of an automated control system. It exemplifies the concept of remote appliance control through DTMF tones, incorporating IR sensors and SMS notifications for enhanced functionality. The project aligns with the principles of embedded systems and has potential applications in home automation, security, and remote monitoring.
